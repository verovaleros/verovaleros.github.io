title: Three Weeks In and I Finally Got It

It has been roughly three weeks since I started to do (almost) daily physical activity. It takes time to form habits, so I went with a really low bar. Just step out of the house and record a workout. Don't care if it's a walk, run, boxing, or whatever.
The first days were not rough; I was happy to do it. The forward motion lasted for a week, then it felt stupid and I started to question what I was doing, etc etc. Textbook mental response. Kept on it. The third week I started to see a semblance of routine and the workout was this thing that happened, and I had the time for it, so why not do it. 

This week I had to move things around and I couldn't work out for a few days, and instead of the common feeling of relief (yeah, day off !), I found myself actually missing the workouts. 

My friends and I joke that I don't get 'the feeling'. Endorphins? I don't have those. Do I ever miss working out? Not me. But this week, it all clicked, and I just wanted to get out there. It seems like a miracle in my books.

I love the work I do, and right now, I need my body to be fit enough so it can carry me through the rest of the things I still want to do. My goal now is twofold: build muscle and win the chronic dehydration battle.

#### Loved this

This week, I found a new podcast episode that I loved. The show is called 'The Imperfects'. I can see how this lured me in, being a perfectionist myself. [Season 6, Episode 19](https://omny.fm/shows/the-imperfects/james-clear-down-the-habit-hole) talks about habits with the author of 'Atomic Habits', James Clear. It is a great, uplifting episode that will get you thinking.
