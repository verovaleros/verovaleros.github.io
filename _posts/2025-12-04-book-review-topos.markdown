I picked up ['Topos by Hugo Alconada Mon (2025)'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232381677-topos) expecting a tight investigation into the Russian spies who lived quietly in Argentina with their kids before being exposed. The premise promised Cold War intrigue transplanted to Buenos Aires suburbs.

The book does recount the basics of the couple and their children, but it never goes beyond a superficial retelling. It feels thin on reporting and light on context, with big gaps where answers or sourcing should be. The narrative wanders and offers little meaningful insight into why they were there, what their mission really was, or how the case was ultimately uncovered.

As an investigative work, it falls short. There is no real sense of discovery, no sharp questions asked or answered, and the prose never compensates for the lack of substance. I wouldn't recommend it.
