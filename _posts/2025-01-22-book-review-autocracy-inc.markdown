I found Anne Applebaum's latest book, ['Autocracy, Inc: The Dictators Who Want to Run the World by Anne Applebaum (2024)'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62919358-spies), a very insightful read. The book puts into words and evidences some of what has been intuitively felt for quite some time already: the world is even more interconnected than what we believe.
A leader of a failed state is not alone in his efforts to cling to power; on the contrary, staying in power is quite essential to other failed states and non-democratic governments.

It is not an objective book, but it is good food for thought.
