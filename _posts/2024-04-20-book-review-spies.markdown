One of my latest reads this month has been ['Spies: The Epic Intelligence War Between East and West'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62919358-spies) by Calder Walton. It was published in June 2023.

I consider this book a new essential read. It gives a very good overview of the last 80 years of the intelligence war between East and West, America and Russia, Capitalism and Communism. While I have been studying intelligence and security books for the last two years, this book felt what I needed when I was starting my master studies. It goes suprisingly deep and at the same time moves forward at a quick pace. It covers very essential topics from before WWII, the start of the cold war, the end, and the rise of a new global situation. Are we heading into a new cold war?
