My 2024 started with two months of severe back pain; it got really bad, which affected my sleep and, from there, the rest of my life and work.
Given the nature of the pain, I saw first a neurologist and then a physiotherapist. We discarded some bad things and concluded that my life/work routine was pretty much taking its toll. Fifteen years of sitting and working 10-13 hours per day, well, not good. 

I am very mindful of my posture when sitting, but the thing is that even if I have a good posture, sitting in that same posture for 10 hours is still bad for the body.

A few weeks ago, my physiotherapist created a routine for me to help with the back pain. We agree on a 30 minute sitting posture rotation: two sitting and one standing, and I rotate at regular intervals to make sure the body does not get super stiff.
The deal is that between the rotations, I take a 5-minute walk or activity (stepper counts!) to make sure the body moves before shifting into the new posture.

Today, I finally got my standing desk at home to fully embrace the rotations and, more importantly, to be able to touch the ground with my feet. I am not a short person, but the fact that the standing desk can be lowered enough so I can put my feet on the ground and at the same time have the keyboard at a healthy level is a huge thing. Both at work and home I have some foot rest to maintain the posture and make sure my legs are not left hanging. Most desks are built for taller people. Now, I am happy to get rid of the foot rest!

Even without the standing desk, my back was already getting better, rotating more, so I am hoping this further helps the health of my back.
