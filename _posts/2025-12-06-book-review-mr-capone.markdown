I picked ['Mr. Capone: The Real—and Complete—Story of Al Capone'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6584299-mr-capone) to get more context on how Capone really operated, and I ended up loving this book. The book gives plenty of detail on immigration, the Chicago of that time, and how the crime families got going once Prohibition gave them room to expand.

It can get a bit romantic at moments, but there is enough practical information on how they moved money and enforced power to keep it grounded. The final part slows down for me, yet overall it is a fun and informative read on Capone and the world around him. I learned so much!
