['The Invisible Spy: Churchill's Rockefeller Center Spy Ring and America’s First Secret Agent of World War II'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210817497-the-invisible-spy) tries to tell the story of Ernest Cuneo, how he acted as a middle man between US agencies, how he worked with foreign services, and how MI6 apparently ran a base out of New York.

Honestly, it had potential to be a great read. However, this is one of those books that you wish the author would have hired a better editor or maybe listened to their editor feedback. The narrative jumps around, repeats itself, and struggles to land a clear point. I struggled to pull out useful insights or even build a clear timeline.

I think that in the end, the book fails to inform or educate, which is frustrating given the subject. I am baffled it earned so many positive reviews elsewhere.
